# Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array (Java)

This repository contains my Java solution for the Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array problem from LeetCode.

## Problem
Given a sorted integer array, remove the duplicates in-place and return the number of unique elements.
The first k elements of the array should contain the unique values.

## Approach
- The array is already sorted
- Keep the first element
- Compare current element with the previous one
- If they are different, store it in the array
- Count the number of unique elements
